# Architecture

WeighIn consists of a TypeScript GitHub Action, a measurement CLI/API, and a
protocol-matched Rust simulation helper. The Action compares configured
benchmarks between a fetched BASE revision and its existing HEAD checkout.
The CLI only measures existing WASMs. [Evidence](EVIDENCE.md) records tested
behavior; [limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) defines the supported scope.

## Entry point and configuration

`action.yml` executes `bundled/index.js` on Node 24. `src/action.ts::run` reads
the declared inputs, resolves the existing GitHub workspace/cwd, and loads HEAD's
policy from the configured TOML path (default `weighin.toml`). Missing optional
policy means report-only. `loadConfig` validates known configuration keys/types;
`validateConfig` rejects malformed/nonfinite/negative rules before measuring.
Fixtures are parsed by `src/identity.ts::parseFixtures`, not the older generic
fixture schema exported from `src/config.ts`.

HEAD is built and measured first. BASE defaults to the PR base branch, otherwise
`main`, or the supplied `base-ref`. The Action fetches that ref from `origin` with
depth 1, then creates a detached worktree at `FETCH_HEAD`. This is not a merge-base
calculation. BASE reads its own fixture file at the same relative path and builds
and measures its own declarations. HEAD policy governs the resulting diff. The
BASE worktree is removed in `finally`; HEAD remains the caller's checkout.

## Contract build selection

`src/build-selection.ts` locates owning Cargo manifests from fixture paths,
reads locked Cargo workspace metadata, and selects uniquely matching workspace
cdylib packages by normalized WASM basename. Multiple declarations of a selected
package share a build. Unknown/ambiguous packages fail before compilation.

`src/build.ts::buildContracts` uses locked optimized `stellar contract build`
with a fresh output directory, producing the modern `wasm32v1-none` artifact.
The builder verifies CLI/Rust gates, optimization, pre/post temporary-storage
write/fsync/read probes and fresh WASM headers before copying to declared paths.
Actual tool versions/artifact hashes are logged. Per-revision Rustup resolution
is preserved unless `rust-toolchain` supplies `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN`.

A custom shell command runs in each revision instead, or `skip-build: true`
consumes prebuilt artifacts. These modes bypass default build guarantees; they
cannot be selected together. The [build document](contract-build.md) describes
the tested versions and storage bounds. The reference's temporary historical
path alias receives modern bytes; it does not compile the obsolete target.

## Two distinct identities

### Logical identity

`parseFixtures` derives the structured tuple:

```text
(fixture_id, logical_id, function_name, case_id)
```

Fixture/contract/invocation `id` fields provide explicit scoped identities.
Fallbacks are normalized workspace-relative fixture path, full fixture-relative
WASM path, and canonical typed arguments. Top-level argument type names are
lowercased; object keys are sorted; array order and values matter. Duplicate
identities fail. Reports use logical fixture/contract/function/case labels.
An explicit ID is the caller's assertion of continuity across revisions.

### Deployment/runtime identity

`src/measurement.ts::runMeasurement` hashes the WASM. That hash determines the
deployment salt; the address also depends on the deployer and standalone network
ID. The same WASM may reuse a deployment; changed WASM can change the address.
Upload and creation transactions are real submitted transactions. A generated
private deployer key is shared across BASE/HEAD in a private temporary file.
`src/account.ts::ensureAccountReady` checks RPC account inclusion and uses local
Friendbot when necessary. The current path assumes the standalone passphrase.

Measurement records retain `wasm_sha256`, runtime `contract_id`, revision SHA and
logical identities separately. Runtime addresses are diagnostics, not the diff
key. `diffBenchmarks` therefore pairs changed WASM/address cases correctly without
silently treating unrelated contracts as the same. See [identity](comparison-identity.md).

## Simulation and resource extraction

Each fixture invocation is converted to ScVals and sent to RPC simulation;
benchmark invocation writes are not submitted or carried into subsequent cases.
`src/simulation.ts::measureInvocation` captures the invocation's footprint and
network configuration at the reported ledger, checks a matching ledger header,
and requires every capture batch to agree. Discovered keys trigger recapture;
ledger drift/incomplete state must resolve within 30 attempts. The exact observed
captive-core JSON-RPC 404 has three bounded retries; arbitrary RPC errors do not.

The adapter provisions the packaged helper source with pinned Rust 1.95.0 and
locked official `soroban-simulation`/`soroban-env-host` 28.0.1 dependencies, or
validates an explicit executable override. Default support is Linux x64,
protocol 28. The helper consumes immutable entries/config/header, recording auth
and a zero seed, and returns consumed native CPU/memory plus resources/XDR.
Archived entries and invalid/missing state fail.

The adapter requires full transaction-data XDR, return ScVal and ordered
successful non-diagnostic event parity with RPC. RPC does not expose direct
consumed CPU/memory. The helper's consumed cost-model values supply compute;
RPC/native resource data supplies audited IO/events. No adjusted instruction
budget is substituted for consumption.

`src/measurement.ts::metricsFromSimulation` emits schema 4: eight measured resource fields and three
unavailable fields with null values/reasons. Caps are decoded from the same
captured configuration; event count has no independent cap. Exact definitions
and source locations are in [metric provenance](metric-provenance.md).

Provenance records helper/library/network/protocol identities, seed/auth/features,
ledger, input/header/snapshot/full-config hashes, compute calibration and resource
limit hashes. Different invocation snapshots may use different ledgers. This
records environment differences; it does not freeze state across the suite.

## Diff and policy

`src/diff.ts::diffBenchmarks` validates all records, including unmatched ones.
Contracts pair by fixture/logical identity, invocations by function/case identity.
It requires equal schemas and compatible compute/resource/source semantics.
Ledger/full-config metadata can change while comparable calibration/caps remain
constant. Mixed historical/current schemas fail explicitly; legacy records only
retain their legacy runtime-address matching against other legacy records.

Comparable deltas are HEAD minus BASE. Positive values mark regressions;
negative values mark improvements. A zero baseline has null percentage, not an
invented finite percentage. Unavailable comparisons have null delta/percentage
and a reason. New/removed contracts/cases are listed separately. The Action
requires at least one matched benchmark, even with no thresholds.

`src/threshold.ts::enforceThresholds` applies HEAD's validated per-function and
global relative rules and absolute HEAD caps. Per-function rules affect every
matching case of that function. Requiring an unavailable metric, exceeding a
cap/relative rule, or configuring a nonignored unmatched function is a failure.
Explicit `ignore` opts out. Numeric caps equal to HEAD consumption pass.

## Reporting and Action outcome

`src/comment.ts::renderComment` renders logical identities, both runtime addresses,
metric sources/caps, both revisions' provenance, deltas, additions/removals and
violations. `src/report.ts` writes optional Markdown and PR metadata; metadata
is written only for PR events. The same report goes to `GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`.

The Action emits `result` and `diff-json` before failing a valid policy violation.
Comparison/build/measurement/configuration errors emit `fail` and `{}`, an error
summary, and unsuccessful execution. There is no successful no-baseline fallback.
Optional direct-comment failure is warning-only.

The separate `comment/` Action runs `bundled/comment-action.js`, reads downloaded
report/PR metadata, and creates or updates the comment carrying
`<!-- weighin-report -->`. It fails on missing artifacts/API failure. The example
consumer runs only after successful PR producers, on trusted default-branch
workflow code; it does not execute downloaded PR code. Failed policy reports
remain in producer artifacts and summaries. Hosted expected-negative proof jobs
separately assert genuine Action exit 1, then finish green once verified.
