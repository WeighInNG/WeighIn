# Metric provenance — protocol 28, schema 4

Supported path: Linux x64, standalone network, official `soroban-simulation`
and `soroban-env-host` **28.0.1**, SDK 16.0.1, captured protocol-28 state.
This audit concerns simulation resources. It does not measure physical disk IO,
CPU hardware instructions, process RSS, or an executed signed transaction.

## Source audit

The pinned crates identify upstream commit
[`7a7629cfef0328881497d60089f9b8acf202a495`](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/tree/7a7629cfef0328881497d60089f9b8acf202a495).
The following source locations explain the mapping:

- `soroban-simulation/src/simulation.rs`: `simulate_invoke_host_function_op`
  records `simulated_instructions` and `simulated_memory` before constructing
  adjusted transaction resources. `SimulationAdjustmentConfig::default_adjustment`
  adjusts instructions, envelope-size estimates and refundable fees, but uses
  `SimulationAdjustmentFactor::no_adjustment()` for read/write bytes.
- `soroban-simulation/src/resources.rs`:
  `compute_adjusted_transaction_resources` passes those IO bytes through and uses
  RW footprint length for write-entry fees. It estimates maximum transaction size;
  this estimate is not the actual signed-envelope size.
- `soroban-env-host/src/e2e_invoke.rs`:
  `invoke_host_function_in_recording_mode` serializes the top-level return ScVal,
  constructs the footprint, counts classic/archive disk-read entry XDR bytes,
  excludes live ContractData/ContractCode from disk bytes, and sums encoded RW
  postimages for write bytes. Deletion has no postimage. Repeated accesses do not
  create repeated footprint keys. `encode_contract_events` excludes diagnostic
  and failed-call events, encodes whole ContractEvents, and adds their sizes to
  the return-value size.
- `soroban-env-host/src/fees.rs`: historical-data fees concern pushed transaction
  history; they do not supply historical read consumption.
- `stellar-xdr` 28.0.0's generated `config_setting_contract_compute_v0.rs`,
  `config_setting_contract_ledger_cost_v0.rs`,
  `config_setting_contract_ledger_cost_ext_v0.rs` and
  `config_setting_contract_events_v0.rs` define the captured resource caps.

[CAP-0066](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/core/cap-0066.md)
explains the distinction between live Soroban in-memory reads, classic/archive
disk reads and the RO+RW footprint cap. Its proposal constants are not used as
runtime limits. The production helper explicitly rejects archived state today.

## All eleven metric names

Limits below are decoded from the same immutable snapshot as the invocation.
No mainnet constants are substituted for a missing limit.

| JSON key | Consumed meaning / source | Limit setting | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cpu_instructions` | Native `simulated_instructions`: metered Soroban cost-model units | ComputeV0 `txMaxInstructions` | Measured |
| `memory_bytes` | Native `simulated_memory`: metered Soroban memory units | ComputeV0 `txMemoryLimit` | Measured |
| `ledger_read_entries` | Total distinct RO+RW footprint keys, including queried absence; **not** read-call count or disk-entry count | LedgerCostExtV0 `txMaxFootprintEntries` | Measured |
| `ledger_read_bytes` | `SorobanResources.diskReadBytes`; charged full entry XDR bytes for classic ledger entries on this supported path; live Soroban reads add zero | LedgerCostV0 `txMaxDiskReadBytes` | Measured |
| `ledger_write_entries` | RW footprint length, including no-op writes and deletion; **not** distinct changed postimages | LedgerCostV0 `txMaxWriteLedgerEntries` | Measured |
| `ledger_write_bytes` | `SorobanResources.writeBytes`: summed encoded RW postimages; no-op postimages count, deletions add zero; TTL/rent handled separately | LedgerCostV0 `txMaxWriteBytes` | Measured |
| `events_count` | Successful non-diagnostic ContractEvent count, including contract/system events | No independent protocol-28 count cap; `null` plus `limit_reason` | Measured |
| `event_data_bytes` | Whole successful ContractEvent XDR sizes **plus top-level return ScVal XDR size**, including XDR overhead/padding | EventsV0 `txMaxContractEventsSizeBytes` | Measured |
| `historical_data_read_bytes` | No corresponding protocol-28 consumption resource; historical-data fee is not a read count | Unavailable | Unavailable |
| `contract_data_hard_limit` | No verified instance-only post-invocation size/corresponding cap mapping; whole entries and per-entry limits must not be silently substituted | Unavailable | Unavailable |
| `tx_size_bytes` | Simulation's padded maximum-envelope estimate is not a signed benchmark transaction | Unavailable | Unavailable |

The pinned helper changes only instruction leeway. Promoting the IO fields relies
on its audited identity adjustment for IO. A future adjustment/library change
must revalidate this mapping; do not generalize all RPC budgets as consumption.
Zero means measured zero; unavailable records have null consumption and a reason.
A measured count with no independent cap is still comparable and usable in
regression policies. Numeric policies are permitted even when no network cap
exists; those configured caps are policy limits, not network limits.

## Transport, parity and environment checks

`src/simulation.ts` validates helper JSON against transaction-data XDR and decodes
return/event XDR. The production adapter requires full transaction-data and
return parity with RPC at the captured ledger. It now also decodes RPC
DiagnosticEvent wrappers and requires identical ordered successful non-diagnostic
ContractEvents. A mismatch fails the benchmark; it never blends conflicting
RPC/local measurements. RPC still supplies no direct consumed CPU/memory values.

Captured ComputeV0 limits must equal the helper's compute limits. All measured
caps are decoded from captured LedgerEntryData, validated, and included in
`resource_limits_sha256`. BASE/HEAD require equal resource-limit hashes, compute
calibration, helper/library/network/protocol/auth/seed identities and per-metric
sources/limits. Fee-only settings and last-modified metadata remain visible in
full config hashes and do not change the resource-limit identity.

Snapshots are per invocation. Live state and ledger-sensitive behavior can still
differ across revisions. Random/auth/archived compatibility limitations remain.
This source audit alone does not establish clean-build or live repeatability;
see the separate [repeatability experiment](repeatability.md).

## Explicit schema migration

New measurements emit `ContractBenchmark.schema_version: 4`. The logical tuple
and runtime diagnostics are unchanged. Measured metrics add `limit_source`, or
`limit_reason` when there is no independent cap. Provenance adds
`resource_limits_sha256`. The helper input/output transport remains schema 1:
its existing footprint/IO/event fields were sufficient for this audit.

The legacy key `event_data_bytes` is retained for configured policies, but schema
4 explicitly defines it as **Events + Return XDR Bytes**, not payload-only bytes.
The report labels `ledger_read_entries` as **Footprint Entries (RO + RW)**,
`ledger_read_bytes` as **Disk Read Bytes**, and `ledger_write_entries` as
**Write Footprint Entries**. They must not be silently relabeled as host call
counts or physical IO. Historical reports retain their old numeric labels.

Schema 3's other nine names were unavailable. Schema 4 promotes six; three stay
unavailable. Mixed schema comparisons fail explicitly. Legacy/schema-2/schema-3
records remain comparable only within their own schema, as before. Generate
both BASE and HEAD with the current producer to use schema 4; do not convert old
records by replacing null values with zero. Unknown/missing sources, changed
caps and incomplete schema-4 provenance fail closed even on unmatched records.
Global all-metric policies still fail on the three unsupported names unless
explicitly ignored. Targeted policies for supported metrics work normally.

## Evidence and reproduction

[Live verification](experiments/metric-provenance/verification.json),
[measurements](experiments/metric-provenance/measurements.json),
[raw RPC](experiments/metric-provenance/rpc-captures.json),
[native inputs/outputs](experiments/metric-provenance/native-replays.json) and
[report](experiments/metric-provenance/report.md) record the actual experiment.

Measured examples: repeated reads plus absence yield 4 footprint keys and zero
disk bytes; no-op write yields 1 RW entry / 80 bytes; deletion yields 1 RW entry /
zero bytes; SAC balance reads 144 classic Account XDR bytes; one event plus return
yields 96 bytes, while a larger return without events yields 652 bytes. These
values apply to the saved fixture/environment, not every Soroban project.

The explicit experiment `tests/experiments/verify-metric-provenance.cjs` builds
an isolated SDK-28 contract with the official Stellar build path, deploys it and
a native Stellar Asset Contract, runs production measurement, and records raw
RPC and native input/output. Observers forward the original IO unchanged.
The production reference contract is not edited.

Run from a repository checkout with the verified Stellar CLI on PATH and an isolated pinned quickstart
network on port 18000:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
npm run build:helper
node tests/experiments/verify-metric-provenance.cjs /tmp/weighin-metric-evidence
npm test
npm run test:native
npm run bundle
node tests/experiments/verify-build-path.cjs /tmp/weighin-full-action-evidence
```

The live fixture covers repeated reads and queried absence, no-op writes,
deletion, positive classic-account disk reads through SAC balance, events, and
a larger return with no events. It verifies all six promoted consumption fields
directly against the parity-accepted raw simulateTransaction response and checks
the loaded caps. Private deployer keys remain in temporary directories.
Frozen-evidence tests independently replay the captured helper inputs; frozen
replay establishes snapshot repeatability, not broader live/build determinism.

## Final Action and CLI proof

[Final Action verification](experiments/metric-provenance/action/verification.json)
uses real Git fetch/worktrees and source builds with a strict write-byte policy.
Control exits 0. Temporary persistent-write HEAD changes WASM/runtime address,
still matches the configured benchmark, increases write bytes 0 → 88 and exits 1.
CPU also increases 266842 → 309171. The Action uses a shared build cache; this is
not five-clean-build or public GitHub CI proof.

```bash
WEIGHIN_EXPERIMENT_POLICY_METRIC=ledger_write_bytes node tests/experiments/verify-build-path.cjs /tmp/weighin-write-policy-proof
```

[CLI results](experiments/metric-provenance/cli-results.json) and
[process capture](experiments/metric-provenance/cli-process.json) show the production
CLI exits 0 and emits six schema-4 measurements with SDK 28.0.0 on the real network.
[Validation](experiments/metric-provenance/validation.json) records final gates;
[operational/test failures](experiments/metric-provenance/validation-failures.json)
record failed attempts and recovery. The proof network was stopped afterward.

These original source/build/data records are local evidence. Subsequent
[repeatability](repeatability.md), [fixture migration](fixture-migration.md),
[local external-project evidence](external-soroban-forge.md) and
[hosted comparison proof](EVIDENCE.md) are recorded separately with their own
producer identities. They do not change the provenance of these earlier records.
