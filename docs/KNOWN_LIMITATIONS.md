# Known limitations

These boundaries describe the current implementation. For exact tested values,
see [Evidence](EVIDENCE.md), [metric provenance](metric-provenance.md) and
[architecture](architecture.md).

| Area | Classification | Current boundary and evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Native platform | Unsupported outside tested path | Default helper provisioning is Linux x64 and Rust 1.95.0; `src/simulation.ts` rejects other platforms. A compatible binary override is not proof of another platform |
| Protocol and network | Protocol-dependent / unsupported | Snapshot measurement requires protocol 28. Deployment uses the standalone passphrase and Friendbot; `rpc-url` is not arbitrary mainnet/testnet support (`src/measurement.ts`, `src/account.ts`) |
| CPU / memory | Protocol-dependent | Official native cost-model consumption, not RPC instruction budgets, hardware instructions, RSS, time or fees. Changing helper/calibration invalidates comparison |
| Three metric names | Unavailable | `historical_data_read_bytes`, `contract_data_hard_limit`, `tx_size_bytes` have null consumption/limit and reasons; required policy rules fail, explicit `ignore` opts out |
| Event count limit | Unavailable independent cap | Event count is measured; no independent protocol-28 count cap. A configured policy cap is permitted |
| Historical/archived state | Unsupported | Current-state capture only; archived snapshot entries are rejected by the helper |
| RPC availability | Environment-dependent | Captures must share a ledger/header and agree with native transaction data, return and events. Thirty capture attempts bound drift/discovered keys; only the exact observed captive-core 404 RPC error gets three bounded retries. Other errors fail |
| State between revisions | Environment-dependent | Snapshots are immutable per invocation, not across the whole suite. BASE/HEAD may use different ledgers. Ledger/time/state changes can change resources. Comparable provenance does not freeze arbitrary state |
| Fixture execution | Unsupported chaining | Invocations are simulated independently; writes are discarded. Upload/deployment is submitted. Prior invocation output/state cannot be referenced as setup for the next case |
| Authorization / randomness | Not yet validated beyond documented mode | Native replay uses recording auth with testutils/recording_mode and a fixed zero seed. It is not signed production authorization. RPC/native disagreement fails rather than blending resources |
| Fixture arguments | Unsupported outside listed conversions | `toScVal` supports bool, string, symbol, u32/i32, u64/i64/u128/i128, address, hex bytes, typed vec/map. Large integers must be strings. Other ScVal types and output substitution are unsupported |
| Contract builds | Environment-dependent | Default build resolves uniquely named workspace cdylib packages from fixture WASM basenames. Tools, locked dependency access and healthy temporary storage are caller requirements. SDK-specific Rust minimums can exceed the builder's gate |
| Custom / prebuilt builds | Environment-dependent | `build-command` and `skip-build` bypass CLI/version/optimization/fresh-output/storage validation. Callers own artifact freshness and comparable build flags |
| Optimizer storage | Environment-dependent | Pre/post write/fsync/read probes catch the reproduced persistent quota failure. They do not reserve capacity or rule out a transient failure solely during optimization |
| Reproducibility | Not yet validated universally | Five clean reference builds and five samples per seven cases were stable on one controlled host/network. This is not cross-machine/compiler/network or arbitrary-contract determinism. Failed setup attempts are retained |
| Multiple contracts | Partially validated | Structured identities avoid cross-contract collisions; tests and the migration bridge exercise multiple declarations. Identical WASM on one network/deployer can share a runtime address. Distinct arbitrary stateful multi-contract suites are not validated |
| Baseline and fixture evolution | Supported with constraints | Action fetches a base ref and uses each revision's fixture contents. Explicit IDs must exist on both sides before moving paths. New/removed cases are reported; at least one case must match. Additions/removals alone have no regression policy |
| Policy scope | Supported with constraints | Per-function rules apply to all logical contracts/cases using that name; no contract/case-specific selectors. No historical trend storage or webhook export exists |
| Historical results | Unsupported mixed-schema comparison | Schema 4 uses current audited semantics. Legacy results retain address matching only against legacy; schemas 2/3/4 cannot be mixed. Remeasure both revisions |
| CLI | Intentionally limited | Measurement JSON from prebuilt WASM only. Comparison, thresholds and GitHub reporting belong to the Action/API |
| GitHub comments | Supported with constraints | Separate consumer runs only for successful PR producers, so policy-failure reports remain artifacts/summaries. Direct comment API errors warn without failing an otherwise valid benchmark. Artifacts require retention/auth permissions. Comment upsert scans one comments API response; it does not paginate or disambiguate multiple marker comments (`src/comment.ts`) |
| Public external-project CI | Not yet validated | Local external-project evidence is retained in [the external experiment](external-soroban-forge.md). It does not prove a hosted workflow in that external repository |

resolved advisory paths, actual execution exposure and validation. Audit results
are a snapshot, not a guarantee against future advisories.
